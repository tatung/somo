# Manipulator Definition

# Author: Moritz A. Graule

# Description:
#     This manipulator definition describes the arm used in the basketball example
#     in the paper "SoMo:  Fast  and  Accurate  Simulations  of  Continuum  Robots
#     in  Complex  Environments" (IROS 2021)

# NOTE: Remember to scale your geometry, stiffnesses, positions, and forces
# by the global scaling factor; no need to scale masses.
